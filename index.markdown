I'm a third year doctoral student in [political science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
My focus is on quantitative methodology for social science research. I'm also interested in the role of social identity on redistributive preferences, with a regional focus on West Africa and the Sahel.

I  worked with the World Bank [Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME)](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDEVIMPEVAINI/0,,contentMDK:23422972~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:3998212,00.html){:target="_blank"} on evaluations in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and the Gambia, and for Queen Máxima of the Netherlands at the United Nations in her role as the [United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development](https://www.unsgsa.org/){:target="_blank"}. I spent a year in Lesotho as a Grinnell Corps fellow from 2005-2006, and two years in northern Madagascar as a Peace Corps volunteer from 2007-2009.

I received an M.P.A. in the Economics of Public Policy from the [Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University](http://wws.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and a B.A. in anthropology from [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu){:target="_blank"}.
