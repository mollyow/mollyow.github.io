I am a post-doctoral fellow with [Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/) at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. My doctoral work is jointly in [Political Science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Statistics & Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}; PhD conferral is expected in December of 2019. 
I work on quantitative methodology for social science research, with a focus on causal inference and experimental design. 

At Yale, I worked in collaborative research labs with [Peter Aronow](http://aronow.research.yale.edu/), [Gregory Huber](http://huber.research.yale.edu/gspd.html), and [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/people/).
