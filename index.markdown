I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in [Susan Athey's](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/sil){:target="_blank"}. 

In July of 2021, I will join the [Department of Political Science at The University of Chicago](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"} as an Assistant Professor. 

I work on quantitative methodology for social science research, with a focus on causal inference and experimental design. My PhD is joint in [Political Science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Statistics & Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}, conferred by Yale University in 2019; I also hold a Masters in Statistics, also from Yale, and a Masters in Public Affairs, from the [Princeton School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

At Yale, I worked in collaborative research labs with [Peter Aronow](http://aronow.research.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [Gregory Huber](http://huber.research.yale.edu/gspd.html){:target="_blank"}, and [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/people/){:target="_blank"}. In the summer of 2018, I interned with Facebook's [Core Data Science team](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/){:target="_blank"}.
