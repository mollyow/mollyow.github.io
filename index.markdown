I'm a doctoral student in [political science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
My focus is on quantitative methodology for social science research, as well as how group experiences and social identity affect redistributive preferences.

The most recent version of my cv is available [here](https://mollyow.github.io/assets/cv_MOW_2017.pdf).

I have been the manager for Yale's [Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS)](http://isps.yale.edu) [Behavioral Research Lab](http://isps.yale.edu/yale-isps-behavioral-research-lab) since the fall of 2016. And I was a 2016-2017 [ISPS Graduate Policy Fellow](http://isps.yale.edu/team/molly-offer-westort), researching interference on social networks. At Yale, I have worked in collaborative research labs with Peter Aronow, [Gregory Huber](http://huber.research.yale.edu/gspd.html), and [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/people/).

Formerly, I  worked with the World Bank [Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME)](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDEVIMPEVAINI/0,,contentMDK:23422972~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:3998212,00.html){:target="_blank"} on evaluations in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and the Gambia, and for Queen Máxima of the Netherlands in her role as the [United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development](https://www.unsgsa.org/){:target="_blank"}. I spent a year in Lesotho as a Grinnell Corps fellow from 2005-2006, and two years in northern Madagascar as a Peace Corps volunteer from 2007-2009.
