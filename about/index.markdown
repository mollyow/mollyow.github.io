I'm a third year doctoral student in [political science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). 
My focus is on quantitative methodology for social science research. I'm also interested in the role of social identity on redistributive preferences, with a regional focus on West Africa and the Sahel.

I have worked with the World Bank Development Impact Evaluation Initiative on evaluations in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and the Gambia, and for Queen Máxima of the Netherlands in her role as the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. I was a Grinnell Corps fellow in Lesotho in 2005-2006, and a Peace Corps volunteer in Madagascar from 2007-2009.

I received an M.P.A. in the Economics and Public Policy from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, and a B.A. in anthropology from Grinnell College.
