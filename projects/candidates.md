summary: "The state of American politics would be generally improved, many argue, if more
moderate and more qualified people served in government. In this paper, we investigate what
draws such individuals to run for elected office, focusing on a dimension of politics that has
received scant attention within the candidate-entry literature—namely, the ability of candidates,
once elected, to exercise meaningful influence and change public policy. In a ratings-based
conjoint survey experiment, we find that the opportunity to wield greater authority increases
moderates’ interest in seeking public office, whereas extremists appear indifferent; and that more
qualified people express more interest in running for office when greater authority is vested in an
office, the threshold needed to pass legislation is lower, and staff support is higher. These
findings have broad implications for our understanding of political representation, government
effectiveness, and the relationship between institutional reform and mass politics."
