summary: "Effective information sharing is critical for the success of organizations and governments. Because
information that is easy to access is more likely to be adopted, leaders often minimize friction in
information delivery. However, one type of friction may increase engagement: piquing curiosity by
posing relevant questions prior to sharing information. To test this, we shared identical information
about COVID-19 in either question-and-answer format or via direct statements across two
preregistered field experiments in Ghana and Michigan (total N=49,395). Q&A-style
communication increased information seeking about directly related topics (e.g., how to wear a
mask properly) by 1.0 percentage-point (216%) in Ghana and by 1.1 percentage-points (19%) in
Michigan (p’s<0.001), and increased self-reported behavior change by 1.3 percentage-points (4%)
in Michigan (p=0.002). However, sharing information in Q&A format did not increase interest in
general COVID-19 information in either setting, suggesting that the impact of Q&A-style
messaging on information seeking may be issue-specific. In Michigan, both Q&A-style and direct
statement messaging produced less information-seeking than sending no informational messages,
likely due to differential attrition: the more texts participants received, the more likely they were to
opt out of receiving messages, which made it impossible for them to seek more information via text.
In a follow-up implementation experiment with social media ads (a messaging strategy without
attrition challenges) Q&A-style ads generated 9-11% more unique clicks to the CDC website per
dollar spent than ads that directly stated information about vaccines (p<0.001). We speculate that
Q&A-style information delivery may stimulate curiosity, driving its benefits."
