summary: "Suppose we have a factorial experiment, where we want to account for
two-way and higher-order interactions. We may think that interaction
effects will be small but not exactly equal to zero, and higher-order
interactions will tend to be associated with smaller effects relative to
lower order interactions.

Accounting for all interactions in a standard linear model may be costly
in terms of variance, so we want to use some form of regularization.

*Hierarchical ridge regression* facilitates penalization that is increasing with
degree of complexity of interactions."
