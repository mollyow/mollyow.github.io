summary: "During mass vaccination campaigns, social media platforms can facilitate the dissemination of public health information but may also contribute to vaccine hesitancy by serving as avehicle for the spread of false and misleading information. 
Although talking with health professionals is an important avenue to address individuals’ concerns, one-on-one conversationswith healthcare providers are challenging to scale. 
Can automated, personalized messaging delivered by a chatbot address individuals’ concerns and increase vaccine acceptance? 
To answer this question, we designed and deployed a Facebook Messenger chatbot to address questions and concerns social media users in Kenya and Nigeria had about the COVID-19 vaccine. 
After optimizing messaging using an adaptive experimental design on 3,905 respondents, we compare the interactive concern-addressing chatbot to a chatbot that delivers a non-interactive public service announcement (PSA), as well as to a control, no information, chatbot condition. 
We find that the concern-addressing chatbot increases COVID-19 vaccine intentions and willingness by 4-5% compared to the control condition, and by 3-4% compared to the PSA intervention. 
Among the 22,052 respondents in our evaluation sample, who at the time of the survey in early 2022 had not yet received a single COVID-19 vaccine, we observe the largest treatment effects among those most hesitant at baseline. 
With advertising costs as low as $0.21 per person engaged and $4.33 per person influenced, policymakers may want to consider using personalized messaging on digital platforms to quickly and cheaply reach many people to encourage compliance with public health programs during disease outbreaks."
