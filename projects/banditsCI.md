summary: "This `R` statistical software package provides functions for conducting frequentist inference on adaptively generated data. 
These functions produce point estimates and confidence intervals, using the methods proposed in [Zhan, Ruohan, et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02029) and [Hadad, Vitor, et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02768). 
The code in this package is directly adapted from the original python code for those publications."
