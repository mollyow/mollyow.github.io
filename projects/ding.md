summary: "(1) Rao type tests may be sub-optimal under nonlocal alternatives (Engle, 1984), and as Ding (2017) shows, the FRT is asymptotically equivalent to a Rao-type test
assuming constant effects. 
Rather than the FRT, a Wald-type analogue to the FRT using the difference in means exists (considered by Freedman, 2008, Samii
and Aronow, 2012, Gerber and Green, 2012, and Lin, 2013) is a valid test of Fisher's null, and does not suffer from the potential pathology of Rao-type tests. 
Furthermore, this Wald-type test—equivalent to a pooled variance two-sample z-test—is asymptotically equivalent to the FRT under local alternatives. 
Reichardt and Gollob (1999) discuss this point, with reference to Mosteller and Rourke (1973). 
(ii) As highlighted by Pratt (1964), Romano (1990) and Freedman (2008), the behavior of tests under incorrect working assumptions may depend on the joint distribution of the data. Analogous to the Behrens-Fisher problem, a test of the null of no average effect that assumes there is no effect on the variance may be more or less powerful than a test of no average effect that makes no such additional assumption. 
We illustrate this by comparing the Wald type analogue to the FRT to the standard Wald-type test of Neyman's null. 
Combining (i) and (ii), we see that Ding's (2017) apparent paradox follows from the use of a suboptimal test under nonlocal alternatives and the well-known behavior of tests of joint hypotheses when one of the constituent hypotheses is false, 
(iii) We also note an error in Ding's (2017) Theorem 7 and suggest a refinement that is correct at full generality. "
